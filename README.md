# Assembly Mergesort 

In this project I tried writing the famous mergesort algorithm in assembly to test my knowledge of assembly. In this project the program first reads a simple text file of ascii integers seperated by new lines. Parses it and saves it in an array of longs in a data buffer then runs mergesort on it and after writes the output to a new file given as an argument to the executable. 

## Compiling and Running 

The host on which you compile the program must be a linux device. This program was written on arch linux and assembly code might or might not work on other distros.
